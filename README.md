## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Private healthcare organizations need to operate sustainably by making sure that it is operating on profit whilst providing their healthcare services. They have to manage risks whilst from time to time providing treatments even to those patients without enough or proper insurance coverage (self-pay patients) or for overseas patients, with or without insurance.

Some cases will turn into cases with write-off (either fully or partially unpaid) which can be due to various and many types of reasons. In use case #1 of this project, the team builds various machine learning models based on the technique that we have learned so far during this semester’s course and then compares the models based on its ability to predict cases with significant write-off, accuracy, number of false positives and various other parameters. We also document our observation of those various models in this project documentation.

For use case #2, the team uses the same data set as use case #1 and transforms it into time-series weekly revenue data for the top 2 revenue contributing countries. The objective for use case #2 is to create a model to predict future weekly revenue numbers based on previous weeks revenue data. How many weeks of revenue data to be used for each model will depend on some statistical auto-correlation analysis. For this use case, results from simple multi-layer neural networks and ARIMA models are observed and compared.

Use case #3 is driven by the business need that In Singapore all inpatient cases are mandated by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to go through a financial counseling process  to make sure patients or their next-of-kin are aware of the estimated cost before they proceed with the treatment and procedures. In this use case, the team applies techniques including ensemble method learned as part of this semester’s material. For the company where we take the data from, there is already an existing Hospital Bill Estimation model in production. Our team decided to try this use case to compare our model versus the current model in production as a comparison and potentially offer it as an alternative model to be considered.
